Details:

The development of the sliding door model requires the usage of multiple objects and scripts. These components are the children of the model since they make up that sliding door. Sliding doors are mostly used in the lobby from my game.

What You Need to Know:
- The placements of objects and scripts DO matter. If you place them in the wrong branches, then the sliding door will not work. 
- The name of the objects (except the scripts) inside the model DO matter. When scripting, you need to reference the objects with their corect names to gain access to them.
- Remember that when you want to move the sliding door accordingly, make sure that the door moves along the corrext axis. For example, if you want the door to move along the x-axis, you need to update the x-value. The y and z values are constant during the run.
